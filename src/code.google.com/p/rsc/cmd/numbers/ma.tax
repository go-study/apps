# This file serves mainly as an example of a complicated numbers program.
# It is a rough calculation of Massachusetts State Income Tax as defined circa 2012.
# It expects to be parameterized with year-specific rates using an additional
# input file, such as ma2013.tax.
#
# Absolutely no claim is being made that this is an accurate computation of
# Massachusetts State Income Tax. The procedure that generated this file was:
#
#	1. Type in rules, more or less.
#	2. Find and fix mistakes until result is somewhat like a few actual
#	   returns created by real tax software.
#
# The result is certainly wrong. Perhaps it is close to right for some inputs,
# but perhaps not. For real tax preparation, use real tax software or a real
# tax preparer.

# TODO: Move most of these constants into year-specific files.

MA Total Income = Total Income
MA Personal Exemption ?= $8,800 # TODO: Is this max(Exemptions, 2) * $4,400 ?
MA Dependent Exemption = $1,000 * max(0, Exemptions - 2)
MA Total Exemptions = MA Personal Exemption + MA Dependent Exemption
MA Rental deduction = $0
MA Dependent deduction = min(max(0, Exemptions - 2), 2) * $3,600
MA Total Deductions =
	Amount paid to social security +
	Amount spouse paid to social security +
	MA Rental deduction +
	MA Dependent deduction
MA Low Income After Deductions = max(MA Low Income - MA Total Deductions, $0)
print(MA Low Income After Exemptions)
MA Low Income After Exemptions = max(MA Low Income After Deductions - MA Total Exemptions, $0)
MA Interest and Dividend Income ?= $0
MA Total Taxable Low Income = MA Low Income After Exemptions + MA Interest and Dividend Income
MA Tax on Low Income = MA Total Taxable Low Income * MA Low Tax Rate
MA High Income ?= Short-term capital gain
MA Tax on High Income = MA High Income * 12%
MA Tax on Long-Term Capital Gain = Long-term capital gain * MA Low Tax Rate
MA Total Income Tax =
	MA Tax on Low Income +
	MA Tax on High Income +
	MA Tax on Long-Term Capital Gain
MA Income Tax After Credits = MA Total Income Tax
MA Total Tax =
	MA Income Tax After Credits +
	MA Out-of-state Use tax
MA Low Income ?= MA Wages
MA Wages ?= Wages
MA Total Payments = MA Income Tax Withheld
print(MA Total Tax)
print(MA Total Payments)
MA Refund = max(MA Total Payments - MA Total Tax, $0)
MA Amount Due = max(MA Total Tax - MA Total Payments, $0)
